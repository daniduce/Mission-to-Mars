# Mission-to-Mars

In this module we covered Beautiful Soup, Mongodb and Splinter. We created a web app that pulls in images of Mar's hemispheres from the NASA website since they allow web scraping. For the full-resolution images of Mar's hemisphere and titles we utilized Beautiful Soup and Splinter to scrape these items and store it in the Mongo Database. In order to display the data, we created a web app to be able to house the images.
